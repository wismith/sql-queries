-- Joins (via the JOIN clause) are how we query data contained in multiple tables.
-- There are two main types of relationships:
--   1. One-to-many
--   2. Many-to-many

-- For example, a customer has many invoices, but each invoice belongs to one
-- and only one customer.  This is a one-to-many relationship.

-- Think of some one-to-many relationships in every day life, e.g.,
--
--   1. A car can get many parking tickets, but a parking ticket belongs to
--      one and only one car.
--   2. Every state in the US has many cities, but every city in the US is in
--      one and only one state.
--   3. Customers can have many orders, but an order belongs to a single customer
--   4. Customers can have multiple credit cards, but every credit card belong
--      to a single customer.
--   5. Think of some of your own.

-- An example of a many-to-many relationship might be events and people.
-- I can attend many events and each event has many attendees.
-- In our toy database, we're only dealing with one-to-many relationships.
